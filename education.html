          I am currently pursuing my bachelor‚Äôs degree at Samtse College of Education, taking a course in IT.
          <span class="more-text">
            Since my childhood, becoming a teacher has always been my dream, and I feel blessed to have been enrolled in this esteemed college of teacher education.
            This journey has not only supported my personal growth but also shaped my professional career.
            Through the program, I have gained deep insights into pedagogy, ICT in teaching, and curriculum design.
            In the near future, I aspire to become an educator who empowers students to explore the digital world with safe ethics and practices.

        <p><strong>Nangkor Central School</strong> (2019‚Äì2022)</p>
        <p class="description">
          I completed my high school education at Nangkor Central School, located in eastern Bhutan under Pemagatshel Dzongkhag.
          <span class="more-text">
            It is one of the renowned schools in the country, often ranking among the top ten in the BCSE results.
            The strong study culture there enabled many students, including myself, to achieve our goals for higher education.
            I feel fortunate to have studied under the inspiring teachers and good leadership of this school.

        <p><strong>Shumar Lower Secondary School</strong> (2017‚Äì2018)</p>
        <p class="description">
          Before that, I attended Shumar Lower Secondary School, which was my first boarding school.
          <span class="more-text">
            It was there that I built the foundation of my education and learned many lessons that helped me personally and academically.
            Out of gratitude for my school, I served as a culture coordinator for one year, an experience that allowed me to develop leadership skills.
            This role not only shaped my mindset but also imparted important values to my life.

        <h2>Primary School</h2>
        <p><strong>Shali Primary School</strong> (2010‚Äì2016)</p>
        <p class="description">
          My education journey began in 2009, though I was officially enrolled in 2010.
          <span class="more-text">
            In 2009, as a four-year-old, I would accompany my father, who was a teacher, to school.
            I was too young to be enrolled then, but my love for learning had already begun.
            These schools nurtured me and laid the basic foundation of my educational journey.
            Looking back, those early days remain some of the most memorable and carefree moments of my life.
            Throughout school, I performed well academically and often topped my class.
            Beyond academics, I actively participated in cultural events, sports, and other activities.
            I also served as a house captain, which further enriched my school experience.
            These opportunities helped me learn new skills, gain knowledge, and guided me toward a better path in life.
